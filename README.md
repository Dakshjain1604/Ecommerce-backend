this is a core backend practice project n which user registers and then the user can login using his/her email id and password , 
then the user can see the list of products and give order by using product id and quantity


i have documented the APIS using Swagger UI

the queries can be accessed using the front-end with the help of graphql 

I have even used redis in this to make the data retrival faster with the help of caching
